Sentry is a **school cyber security system** developed in Python. It's a private project that I have been working on for one year. The goal of Sentry is to provide robust security measures for educational institutions, ensuring the safety of student's computers.

## Features
- Protect the computer from malicious programs in startup folder.
- Prevent wallpaper changes.
- Generate reports on security incidents and vulnerabilities.
- Report to the database.
- Scan files for viruses.
- Block different websites.
- Prevent installed apps from runing for a specified time. (Disable any app which can students help on exams)

## Usage
If the client, and the enviorment is ready, then you just have to start the software. Then you have to register a user from the administrator terminal window, and then login with these credentials.
After that you will face the menu of Sentry where you can select various options, such as blocking websites, blockin apps from running, etc.

# Setup client and database for testing
| If you want to run Sentry, you have to setup the enviorment. First of all you have to get the client, then you have to setup the SQL database localy. (Server and client in MySQL)
